I have been in India for about one month. When I stayed home, I always had 
Japanese rice and I was satisfied with it. 
But all Japanese rice I brought from Japan is consumed yesterday. 
So when I went shopping with my Indian driver as usual, I asked him 
where I can buy Japanese rice. He told that getting Japanese rice in India 
is very difficult. Here is India, so I'm convinced of his answer.
In such a way I had no choice but to buy Indian rice, so I did it. 
I thought that the difference between Japanese and Indian rice is 
not big deal, since I have not felt the taste of Japanese rice I always have.
Only difference is that Indian rice is longer and narrower than Japanese one, 
I thought. 

In the evening I cooked chiken, onion and green pepper which are boiled 
with chinese taste souase. The side dish was well cooked for me.
While I cooked, the rice was completed. Then I started to have dinner.
The side dish is very good, but Indian rice doesn't suit me at all. 
Indian rice totally removed the good taste of my side dish!
I knew the importance of rice at that time.

Next day I cooked much fied rice from all Indian rice.
It can be eaten if I try to do.
